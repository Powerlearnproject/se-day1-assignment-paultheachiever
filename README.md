#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the engineering approach which involves designing ,developing ,testing and maintaining software systems
software engineering plays a key role in todays world technology industry helping to improve efficiency productivity and performance of its processes
by creation of high performance softwares. Also since Security is a major concern in modern technology. Software engineers implement security best practices, such as encryption, authentication, and vulnerability testing, to protect systems from cyber threats.



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
there are many milestone in evolution of software engineering some of them include:
i}The Software Crisis & Birth of Software Engineering (1968)
In thi stage of evolution due to increased challeges in softwares development software engineering was introduced leading to introduvction and development of structured programming 
and formalizad methordologies

ii}Rise of Agile Methodologies (2001)
The Agile Methodology was published. This helped promoting flexible, iterative software development over rigid, sequential models like Waterfall.
Agile frameworks like Scrum and Kanban  All these methodologies improved efficiency, adaptability, and customer collaboration. 

iii}DevOps & Cloud Computing Revolution (2010s – Present)
The integration of DevOps and clound computing practices has streamlined software development, deployment, and operations, enabling continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).
Cloud computing (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) transformed software scalability, accessibility, and cost efficiency.



List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 In software development lifecycle there are  following key phases involved:

    Planning
        Defines the project scope, objectives, resources, and timeline.
        Conducts feasibility studies to assess technical, financial, and operational viability.

    Requirement Analysis
        Gathers and documents user needs and system requirements.
        Identifies functional and non-functional requirements.

    Design
        Creates system architecture, user interface design, and database models.
        Specifies hardware, software, and security requirements.

    Implementation (Coding & Development)
        Developers write and integrate the actual code based on design specifications.
        Programming languages, frameworks, and tools are selected.

    Testing
        The Software undergoes various tests unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing to identify and fix bugs.
        Ensures performance, security, and usability.

    Deployment
        The tested software is released for end-users, either as a full launch or phased rollout.
        Cloud or on-premise deployment strategies may be used.

    Maintenance & Support
         in this stage some activities are implemented they include Regular updates, bug fixes, and improvements are applied.
        Adapts the software to new requirements and technologies.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
i}In waterfall methodology Entire project is delivered at the end while in agile the feedback is provided in each stage of development 
ii}waterfall methodology is Highly risky as errors are mostly found  late in development can make the process be costly while in Agile early testing and feedback is done helping identify issues sooner
iii}In waterfall users involvement is mostly minimal as users are mostly involved at the start and at the end of the project while in Agile there is High customer involvement with frequent feedback and reviews
iv}in waterfall each phase (Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment) is completed before moving to the next while in Agile Work is done in small iterations (sprints), allowing for continuous improvements
